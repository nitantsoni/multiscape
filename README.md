## About

MultiScape is a Mac application to make wallpapers that span multiple monitors. It will automatically scale the source image, crop it for the monitors and save the images

## How to use

When you start the application it will calculate the required image size to make the spanning wallpapers and display it. For best results, take an image larger than this size, and drag&drop it onto the window. 

The output is saved in the User/Pictures/MultiScape folder  

## Thanks

David Zwerdling for the original code


## Changes from parent repo

- Crop from top left corner instead of bottom left corner
- Images are cropped left to right from the source, with the highest display ID first
- Minor changes to enable compatibility with macOS 12 Monterey
